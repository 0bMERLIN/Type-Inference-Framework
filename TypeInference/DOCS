Stable:
  the stable version of the type inferencer.
  no support for data structures.



Experimental (ADTs):
  basically stable + support for ADTs:
  
  data MaybeInt
  = Just Int
  | Nothing



Experimental (GADTs):
  support for adts with type variables:

  data Maybe a
    = Just a
    | Nothing

  problems:

  the GADTs can only be concrete. You cant have

  f : forall m a b . (a -> m a) -> a -> m a



Experimental (GADT-TVs):
  solves the problem of the previous iteration, but
  lacks kind inference, so it sometimes lets errors
  pass.
